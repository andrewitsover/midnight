# Flyweight
An ORM for SQLite and NodeJS. Flyweight is different from other ORMs in that it combines a very simple API for performing basic operations, with the ability to create SQL queries that are typed and automatically mapped to complex object types.

The problem with traditional ORMs is that they require you to learn an entirely new and complex abstraction that tries to mimic many of the features of SQL. Flyweight simply allows you to use SQL, without any extra mapping code.
